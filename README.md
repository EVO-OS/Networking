# Networking
The Networking component of the kernel manages network interfaces, protocols, and communication between devices. This includes support for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other networking technologies.

## Overview

The Networking component is responsible for handling all network-related functionalities in the kernel. It includes the network stack, network drivers, and support for various network protocols and interfaces.

## Components

### 1. Network Stack

- **Protocol Handling**
  - Manages network protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, and ICMP.
  - Handles data packet routing and communication between devices.

- **Network Interfaces**
  - Manages the integration and communication of network interfaces like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

### 2. Network Drivers

- **Ethernet Drivers**
  - Handles wired network interfaces and communication.
  - Interfaces with Ethernet hardware.

- **Wi-Fi Drivers**
  - Manages wireless network interfaces.
  - Interfaces with Wi-Fi hardware and manages wireless connections.

- **Bluetooth Drivers**
  - Handles Bluetooth communication protocols.
  - Includes Bluetooth stack, HCI (Host Controller Interface), and device drivers.
  
- **Other Network Drivers**
  - **Cellular**: Manages cellular network interfaces.
  - **VPN**: Supports Virtual Private Network configurations.

### 3. Bluetooth Integration

- **Bluetooth Stack**
  - Manages Bluetooth communication protocols and profiles.
  - Includes core protocols (L2CAP, RFCOMM) and profiles (A2DP, HFP).

- **Bluetooth HCI**
  - Provides a communication interface between the Bluetooth stack and hardware.

- **Bluetooth Device Drivers**
  - Interfaces with Bluetooth hardware chips and adapters.
